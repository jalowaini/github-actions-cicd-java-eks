## 🔄 Jenkins Pipeline Stages

| Stage             | Description                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Checkout        | Pulls source code from GitHub                      |
| ✅ Maven Build     | Compiles project and generates `.jar`              |
| ✅ Docker Build    | Builds Docker image from the `.jar`                |
| ✅ Push to ECR     | Pushes the Docker image to Amazon ECR             |
| ✅ Deploy to EKS   | Applies Kubernetes manifests (deployment/service) |
| ✅ Post-deploy Test| Verifies that the app is running and reachable     |

## ✅ Results

- CI/CD is fully automated via Jenkins  
- Docker Image stored in **Amazon ECR**  
- App is deployed to **Amazon EKS** with public access  
- Structure is production-ready and easily extensible
